Weather Nowcasting

This project focuses of now-casting weather, predicting precipitation values for the next 3hrs using classical machine learning models and deep learning models such as LSTM. 

Data hading and Exploratory Data Analysis is done on the the dataset for clear understanding of factors and features affecting precipitation with highest correlation(Reflectivity).
